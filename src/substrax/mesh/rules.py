"""NNX SPMD sharding utilities.

This module provides utilities for configuring sharding strategies
in JAX SPMD training, following upstream Flax NNX patterns.

The core abstraction is MeshRules, which maps logical dimension names
(data, embed, mlp, heads) to physical mesh axis names. Factory functions
create standard configurations for data-parallel and FSDP training.

Example:
    mesh = jax.make_mesh((4, 2), ("data", "model"))
    rules = fsdp_rules(data_axis="data", model_axis="model")
    spec = partition_spec_for_names(rules, "data", "embed")
    # => PartitionSpec("data", "model")
